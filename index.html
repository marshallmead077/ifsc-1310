  <h1>Dragon Project Revision and Reflection</h1>
  <p>
    My first attempt at the dragon project was very fun and challenging, mostly because I made my design too complex for my level of skill with code. The outcome of the first attempt to me was successful, because I got to really challenge my self, and I was able to create my own site with the freedom to add what ever I wanted. 
    
    When I showed my first attempt to my family, they said it was good and did not see any problems, other than then it being hard to read because of the background color. When I showed my friends in the web development program that are more advanced than me, they said that it was too complicated because of so many section and headers and would make everything really confusing and difficult to style. They were very right this was really hard and most of my CSS never did anything to change the site because my HTML was not correct when trying to target things. 
    
    Even though the site looks good, it is actually very broken when it comes to viewing it anywhere other than my own computer. I spent hours trying to figure out what was wrong, but with so much code to go through, it was almost impossible to find the problem. So for my second attempt I went ahead and started from scratch and made the site much more simple. This made everything go by so much smoother and faster. I had almost no problems getting the site to look how I wanted. I kept the same idea that I had with my first attempt, but left out all the sections and headers and only kept the main header that held the navigation. I also changed the background color and font style to something easier on the eyes. When my family looked at my second attempt, they had no problem reading the content and said it was much better. 
    
    What I learned from this project is to keep things simple and not to try to make something too complex, and to stick with what I know for now until I become better at code. My experience in this semester was almost what I thought it would be. I had a lot of fun learning and trying new things. When we first started to go over code, it was scary because it was so much to take in, but the more I worked on the assignments giving it got easier, and now I understand it a lot more than I did coming in. this semester was easier than I thought it would be because I thought I would have a hard time trying to figure things out, but I am glad that I found people in the program that helped me a lot understand how HTML and what being a web developer is all about. Also, having great teachers was a huge help as well.  
    
    I think I did pretty well in this class and if I had to start over this class I would not really do anything different because what I did do worked well, and I think I got the best learning experience out of this way. Going ford into next semester, my strategy will stay the same, and I am very excited and ready to take on the new challenges next semester brings.

  <h1> What is Progressive Enhancement</h1>
  <p>Progressive Enhancement is a method in web design that makes the page loads the HTML first. This allows people to access the site faster because it is not trying to load all the information like CSS and java right when you open the page. This is helpful and important to users because of how much faster and lighter it makes webpages for people who have slow internet speeds or older computers. Before this method, websites would need to load all the code content of the page for the user to even use the website. Also, if there were any errors in the code, the site would not be usable even if the errors had nothing to do with the core content. This is a good method and fix and makes surfing the web and being a web developer less stressful.</p>
