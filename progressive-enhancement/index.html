<h1> What is Progressive Enhancement</h1>
<p>Progressive Enhancement is a method in web design that makes the page loads the HTML first. This allows people to access the site faster because it is not trying to load all the information like CSS and java right when you open the page. This is helpful and important to users because of how much faster and lighter it makes webpages for people who have slow internet speeds or older computers. Before this method, websites would need to load all the code content of the page for the user to even use the website. Also, if there were any errors in the code, the site would not be usable even if the errors had nothing to do with the core content. This is a good method and fix and makes surfing the web and being a web developer less stressful.</p>
